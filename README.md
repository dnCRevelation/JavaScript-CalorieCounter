# A simple calorie counter application that utilizes JavaScript to record entries from the user with the food name, and calorie amounts as a parameter, along with the calorie budget daily

### This app will take those inputs, calculate the calorie surplus or deficit compared to your set calorie budget, including the total calories consumed, burned, and budgeted. Also includes a function to clear the form for other calorie budgets and add multiple entries.
